To use the SHEAR Weather Reporter, you need to create a tab delimited export ﬁle using the Davis WeatherLink Computer 
Software available at https://www.davisinstruments.com/product/weatherlink-computer-software/.
1. Choose Export from the Browse menu.
2. Select the desired days, months, or years (you may choose more than one) and choose OK.
